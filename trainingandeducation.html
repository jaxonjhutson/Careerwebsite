                <h2>Training/Education</h2>
                <p class="misctext">Surprisingly, it seems that a degree is not required to actually get a fine job as a IT technician. The number one education suggestion I see is to get a certification within the IT field, like a CCNA (which I am pursuing now). Another peice of advice I commonly see is to develop self-taught skills that relate to IT, like knowing how to figure out a problem that could occur with an office computer, getting familiar with both hardware and software, and learning how networks work and how to manage them.</p>
